Most of the methods in AcSdk.dll can be read with a decompiler (I personally use this one: http://devextras.com/decompiler/)

Any files which cannot be I have decompliled by hand and put them in this directory. Some MSIL code is interleaved through it, this is mostly as a reference so I can find lines in the MSIL easier.
