AssettoCorsaTelemetry
=====================

A telemetry application to use with Assetto Corsa

The end goal is to create a solid telemetry application with the ability to post the data online for other to critique or learn from. There may eventually be a mobile version.

The data is currently saved in a .csv format in your documents folder if you wish to look at the raw data gathered. You can also send this file to friends to load into this application and look at.

Only 3 things have been added so far: an Rpm/Speed chart, minimap, and a friction circle.

You can even change to to look at a certain sector of a lap (or a certain sector of all the laps combined).
